# MERN Stack: Book Search Engine

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)


## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the code from an existing RESTful API into a MERN stack using Apollo Server/Client and GraphQL. I learned a lot about the different ways these APIs work and the different methods required for their functionality.
